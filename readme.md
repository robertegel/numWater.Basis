This project is built on a previous unpublished group project which developed a complex numeric model simulating a water supply systems behavior with multiple processes.

This group project by Markus Schr√∂der, [Elisa Zscherper](https://github.com/zscherpelli), Isabelle Fitkau and Robert Egel was built to show interactions of various physical processes in a water supply system. It was developed in the *Multi-Physics Approaches for Modeling Civil Systems* by TU Berlins Department for Civil System Engineering.

While this project focuses on the development of difference equation systems, it's successors approach further aspects, i.e. [uncertain rainfall](https://github.com/robertegel/numWater.Stochastic) and [social influences](https://github.com/robertegel/numWater.Social).
